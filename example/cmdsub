#  cmdsub - skeleton file for the Lab on Command Substitution and Arithmetic
#   for Greg Boyd's CS160B class
#
# this next command will copy the contents of the first argument
# into the variable LINE. If no first argument was specified, the program
# will abort with a message.
LINE=${1:?"must run $(basename $0) with a line of text as an argument"}

# In this shell script you should try to report everything in human-readable
# sentences.  You must use command and arithmetic-substitution to place
# the output of your commands in text messages about them. Here is an example:
#   nitems=$(ls | wc -l)
#   echo "There are $nitems items in the directory $PWD"

# Now report the following information using $LINE:
#   - the line of text itself enclosed in " "
#   - the number of characters in the line of text
#   - the number of words in the line of text


# Next, report the number of users, not including yourself, that are logged
# into hills. The number should be unique users - and not include duplicates.
# (hint: look at the output of who)

# Last, output a random number between 0 and 1000. You can use the $RANDOM
# variable for this, with arithmetic and the modulus operator (get the
# remainder of $RANDOM and 1000)


# That's it for the shell script! Do the analysis at the end of the lab, 
# then transfer cmdsub to get credit for the lab today!
